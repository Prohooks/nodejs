# Prohooks

This is the official wrapper for the Prohooks API. With Prohooks, you can easily create and manage webhooks and timers.

## Installation

You can install Prohooks using npm:
```
npm install prohooks
```

## Usage

Here's an example of how you can create a new client and use it to get scheduler info and create a timer and delete a timer:

Example code for creating a new Client:

```js
// for common JS
const { ProHooks } = require("prohooks");
// for ESX
import { ProHooks } from "prohooks";

const proHooksClient = new Prohooks("yourapikeyhere");
```

Example of how to get a scheduler's info:

```js
const info = await proHooksClient.get("timeridhere");
```

Example of creating a new timer:

```js
const created = await proHooksClient.create(
    {
        name: "Hook name",
        url: "https://google.com", 
        headers: {"Content-Type": "application/json"},
        method: "GET", 
        payload: { "key": "value" },
        duration: "10m"
    }
);
```
